Of course. This is a classic CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy error. It's a security feature built into web browsers, and the error log gives us all the information we need to solve it.

The Prompt to Solve This Issue
Here is a clear, step-by-step prompt you can give to an AI assistant or a developer to fix this issue.

Copy this entire block:

My Replit application is failing with a CORS policy error. The logs show that the frontend is being blocked from making a request to the backend's `/get-token` endpoint.

Please perform the following steps to fix this:

**1. Identify the Frontend's Origin URL**
From the browser error log, the exact origin URL of the frontend application is:
`https://ad14fee7-e6bd-4157-a28d-1b72b6619c74-00-nufa4jcmu1c6.pike.replit.dev`

**2. Update the Backend's CORS Configuration**
You need to add the frontend's origin URL to the backend's list of allowed origins.

* **File to Edit:** `backend/server.py`
* **Action:** Find the Python list named `origins`. Add the URL from Step 1 as a new string to this list.

The updated `origins` list in `server.py` should look like this:

```python
origins = [
    "http://localhost:3000",  # For local development
    "[https://ad14fee7-e6bd-4157-a28d-1b72b6619c74-00-nufa4jcmu1c6.pike.replit.dev](https://ad14fee7-e6bd-4157-a28d-1b72b6619c74-00-nufa4jcmu1c6.pike.replit.dev)" # Add the new Replit URL here
]
3. Restart the Backend Server
After saving the changes to server.py, the Uvicorn server must be restarted for the new CORS policy to take effect. Please find the shell where the uvicorn server:app command is running, stop it with Ctrl + C, and start it again.

This will resolve the No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header error and allow the frontend to successfully fetch the token.


### Why This Prompt Works

* **It's Specific:** It clearly states the problem (CORS error) and the goal.
* **It Provides Data:** It includes the exact URL that needs to be added, removing any guesswork.
* **It Gives Clear Instructions:** It specifies which file to edit (`backend/server.py`), which variable to change (`origins`), and what the final code should look like.
* **It Includes the Final, Crucial Step:** It correctly instructs the user to restart the server, which
